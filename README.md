A simple cloud-native monitoring app using Python modules with a bit of design using HTML and containerized it using Docker, the app is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Writing the Script

We need an IDE or Integrated Development Environment like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for writing the code as they provide us with suggestions and point out the mistakes in the code. We need to import a few Python modules like the **psutil** for getting the system health metrics and the **Flask** module for running the application in Flask. We can also include a warning message to be displayed if the CPU or Memory Utilization goes above 80 percent. Lastly, we need to include the port number for example **0.0.0.0**, the local host to host the application.
